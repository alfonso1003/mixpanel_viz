ABOUT:
Included is a 2 month export of event data from Mixpanel.
1) The events.txt file is in JSON format.
2) The email addresses have been anonymized, but are internally consistent such that john.doe@abcdefg.com if anonymized to 123@example.com will be 123@example.com throughout the file.
3) Any dates/times are stored as unix timestamps since Midnight, Jan. 1st, 1970 - UTC.

TASK:
Using any language that you like and any frameworks/libraries that you like, please create a visualization, table, chart(s) or any other representation of this data that allows the end-user to get a good understanding of the data and any insights contained therein.

OUTPUT:
You can either send me the files to run, deploy to another server where I can view the results, or any other means for that matter. Whatever works best for you.
